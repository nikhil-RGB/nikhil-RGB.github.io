                            "Connway's Game-of-Life", a simple example of basic Cellular Automata <br/>
                            A cellular automaton is a discrete model of computation studied in automata theory. Cellular automata<br/> 
                            are also called cellular spaces, tessellation automata, homogeneous structures, cellular structures,<br/>
                            tessellation structures, and iterative arrays.<br/>
                            Game-of-Life is a 0-player game which demonstrates this automata concept.<br/>
                            This Application is a Desktop GUI application and can run on any computer system with a JRE.<br/>

                            Chain Reaction(3.0) Chain Reaction was a game originally designed by Matt-buddy entertainment for android devices,
                             but it's honestly such a great game, that I decided to port it to PC. Enjoy chain reaction, reprogrammed to be a
                             desktop application, and with an added new Explosion mechanic to keep things fresh. The fun part of the game is the
                            unpredictability, where it seems as though one player is winning, but the tables can be turned with just one move! This
                            version of chain reaction includes an option for upto 7 AI players! Enjoy testing your chain reaction skills against
                            computer controlled players! NOTE:The user will require JAVA(1.5 to 1.9) installed to use this application.<br/>

                           "Genichiro: The Rival" is a mod of the 2019 Game of the Year "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice".<br>
                           This mod focusses on a complete redesign of the battle between the main character(Sekiro) and Genichiro Ashina atop Ashina castle.
                           The creation of this mod involved rewriting animation frame data for most of Genichiro's attack animations, re-balancing in-game numerical stats,
                           combining various animations to form new attacks- and rewriting his LUA code to change his aggression patters, and offensive and defensive reactions.
                           This boss-focussed gameplay mod aims at making the fight severely punishing and extremely difficult, unlike the base-game fight, which is more of a training fight to
                           teach the game's mechanics, and should give even very experienced players a run for their money.<br/>
